Hello! 👋 I'm a full stack web developer with a lot of enthusiasm for positive impact and problem-solving. My way of working is solution-oriented and takes into account business goals, quality, usability, and scalability. I work best in a team with plenty of autonomy, feedback, and clarity. 

Nothing makes me happier than when we reach our goals together! 🫶 Meaningful work, for me, means contributing to net positive social and environmental impact and empowering others at work.

Outside office hours, you'll usually find me away from the screen tending to plants, being in nature, traveling, trying something new, or chasing PRs at the gym.
