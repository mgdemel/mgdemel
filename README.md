### Hi there 👋

I'm a content manager turned coder with a passion for building things that make a positive impact. For example, I enjoy building processes and tools to help people automate what's mundane and engage in meaningful work. I also enjoy building things that measurably meet or surpass business goals.  

Outside office hours, you'll usually find me away from the screen tending to my houseplants or garden, traveling and experiencing new cultures, or trying to beat a one-rep-max PR at the gym.
